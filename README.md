# github-actions-quickstart
The Quickstart was well explained and worked perfectly by following the provided instructions. The screenshots and extra resources made it easier to follow up especially for someone doing this for the first time.
However there were some ambiguities I had about the code base. If the code could have more documentation through comments or a ReadMe file that would make understanding stuff easier. For example in the actual code I was unable to understand what was $f{{ github.actor }} or when did
'steps:' mean.
Moreover please provide more information on concepts like jobs, steps, runs etc because I had to look up various youtube videos and online articles to get a grasp.
Similarly the definition of a Github Action was confusing I really did not understand what pipeline or CI/CD meant so if we could get a defintion or links to definition that would make understanding it a bit easier.
